# Poker Game

A poker game I made to play with my own card themes, rules and stuff.

## Card Making

Every card was made by me. To do this, I created the ``!CARD MODEL.pdn`` file, inside the ``/cards/src`` folder, so that changing any element of the cards layout becomes a simple task.

> The ``.pdn`` file means that the card model was made with [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/).

For instance: in the image bellow, the `CLUB` and `A` layer's checkbox are checked, so you get an Ace of Clubs.
